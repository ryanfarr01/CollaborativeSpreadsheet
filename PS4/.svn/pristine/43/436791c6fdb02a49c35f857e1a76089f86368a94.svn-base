Problem: A cell can have a content of string, double, or formula. It does not appear that this will cause any sort of problem yet, but it is 
something to keep in mind for the future.

Notes on defining a cell class:

store:
content
value

fuctions:
get content
get value

Note: For now this does not matter as we do very little with cells, but should a cell be invariant? If a cell is redefined in the spreadsheet should a new cell be created, or 
should the old cell be changed?

Storing key value pair.

Note: helper method to update cell values.
